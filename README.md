In this repositroy You I try to create efficient time series model (ARMA) to predict future net value of Microsoft.
You can find here python file with all of the code and txt files which contains the data I was working while creating this model,
because since the time I downloaded this data it alread could have changed.

Python code has been written in google colaboratory (jupyter notebook) so You can run it by yourself any time you want.
In case you had some problems with loading data in jupyter you can also upload it by yourself from your computer.

I hope this small project will prove my skill in predicting time series.
